        <h1>Haight Ashbury</h1>
        <p>
          Haight-Ashbury is by far, my favorite district in San Francisco. This neighborhood is
famous for being the birthplace of hippie counterculture in the 1960s. It became a haven for
young people across the country who protested capitalism, consumerism, and everything 1950s
America is famous for. Haight-Asbury became a community based upon countercultural ideas,
drugs, and music.
	The summer of love, in 1967, marked the entrance of psychedelic rock music into the
mainstream, for which Haight-Ashbury served as a hub. Jefferson Airplane, the Grateful Dead,
and Janis Joplin all lived very close to each other and were huge members in the Haight
community.
	Today, the Haight is a still a heart of counterculture fashion, music, comedy, and food. Many
newer bands can be found playing concerts there, and every summer the Haight-Ashbury Street
fair is a weekend long celebration of art, music, and free love. You can still find loads of tie-dye
in the thrift stores and the occasional vagabond wandering from here to nowhere.
