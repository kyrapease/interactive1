        <h1>Haight Ashbury</h1>
        <p>
          Haight-Ashbury is by far, my favorite district in San Francisco. This neighborhood is
famous for being the birthplace of hippie counterculture in the 1960s. It became a haven for
young people across the country who protested capitalism, consumerism, and everything 1950s
America is famous for. Haight-Asbury became a community based upon countercultural ideas,
drugs, and music.
	The summer of love, in 1967, marked the entrance of psychedelic rock music into the
mainstream, for which Haight-Ashbury served as a hub. Jefferson Airplane, the Grateful Dead,
and Janis Joplin all lived very close to each other and were huge members in the Haight
community.

	Today, the Haight is a still a heart of counterculture fashion, music, comedy, and food. Many
newer bands can be found playing concerts there, and every summer the Haight-Ashbury Street
fair is a weekend long celebration of art, music, and free love. You can still find loads of tie-dye
in the thrift stores and the occasional vagabond wandering from here to nowhere.

<h2>Love on Haight</h2>
        <p>
            Love on Haight is one of my favorite stores in Haight-Ashbury. It is filled wall-to-wall with
every imaginable article of clothing tie-dyed with pastels, vibrant colors, or weird patterns.
Everything you need to become a modern day music-loving flower child lives in this store. There
is also wonderful history about the Haight and the influence the Grateful Dead had on the district
in a little waiting area in the back. If you want to meet some original hippies who thrived in
Haight Ashbury in all its glory, the owners of this store are your people. Plus, the vibes are pretty
groovy!

<h3>Grateful Dead House</h3>
      <p>
    The Grateful Dead House (710 Ashbury St) is another super cool landmark in Haight Ashbury.
This is the house the Grateful Dead lived in throughout the late 60s-early 70s while making some
of their earlier hits, and while the counterculture movement in the Haight was thriving. A
beautiful townhouse with a lot of creative energy, this house is a must-see for any Dead Head, or
person trying to understand what is going through the heads of all the hippies twirling around this
part of San Francisco.

<h4>Decades of Fashion</h4>
        <p>
          Decades of Fashion is like the letterform archive of vintage clothing. Authentic, beautiful
clothing from all classic American decades starting in the 1920s has a home in this hidden gem
of a thrift store. Looking for accessories, shirts, pants, dresses, or anything in between? Every
single thing for sale inside Decades of Fashion has its own unique story, and will make your
wardrobe about 30x better. (My favorite personal purchase from here is a sky blue 1970s cowgirl
shirt). One of the best stores in all of San Francisco, Decades of Fashion makes Haight Ashbury
even cooler - if thatâ€™s even possible.
