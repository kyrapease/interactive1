  <div class="caption">I'm the one who writes SUPER long captions for all of my photos which you think is great at first but you inevitably get exhausted and bored after reading more than two or three lines
about what amazing life-changing revelation I just had, plus I remind you that maybe social media might actually be a waste of time… but then what's the point of your precious phone? And what about all the posts you would miss??
Plus, we both know your attention span won't make it through this thing.
So instead of reading the rest of my caption about what I think the meaning of life is, or some other actually valuable knowledge about the human experience, you should probably just keep scrolling.
